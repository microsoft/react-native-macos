# macOS API Reference

Welcome to the React Native macOS API reference documentation. This section covers macOS-specific props and events that extend the standard React Native components.

## View Component Extensions

React Native macOS extends the standard View component with additional props and events designed specifically for macOS:

- **[View Props](./view-props.md)** - macOS-specific properties for customizing view behavior
- **[View Events](./view-events.md)** - macOS-specific events for handling user interactions

These extensions allow you to build truly native macOS experiences while leveraging the React Native framework.
