# macOS API Reference

Welcome to the React Native macOS API reference documentation. This section covers macOS-specific props and events that extend the standard React Native components.

Most of the additional functionality out of React Native macOS directly is in the form of additional props and callback events implemented on `<View>`, to provide macOS and desktop specific behavior. We also have some additional APIs, like platform specific colors.
