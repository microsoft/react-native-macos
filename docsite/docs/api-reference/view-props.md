# View Props (macOS)

React Native macOS extends the standard React Native View component with additional props that are specific to macOS. These props allow you to customize the behavior and appearance of views to take advantage of macOS-specific features.

## Props

### `acceptsFirstMouse`

Controls whether the view accepts the first mouse click when the window is inactive.

| Type | Default |
| ---- | ------- |
| bool | `false` |

When `true`, the view will respond to mouse clicks even when the window is not in focus, without first bringing the window to the foreground.

---

### `allowsVibrancy`

Enables the vibrancy effect for the view, allowing it to blend with the content behind the window.

| Type | Default |
| ---- | ------- |
| bool | `false` |

When `true`, the view will use macOS vibrancy effects, creating a translucent appearance that adapts to the content behind the window.

---

### `cursor`

Specifies the mouse cursor to display when hovering over the view.

| Type   | 
| ------ |
| string |

Sets the cursor style. Common values include `'pointer'`, `'default'`, `'text'`, etc.

---

### `draggedTypes`

Specifies the types of dragged content that the view accepts for drag and drop operations.

| Type            |
| --------------- |
| array of string |

An array of UTI (Uniform Type Identifier) strings that the view will accept. For example: `['public.file-url', 'public.text']`.

---

### `enableFocusRing`

Controls whether the standard macOS focus ring is displayed when the view has focus.

| Type | Default |
| ---- | ------- |
| bool | `true`  |

When `true`, macOS will draw the standard focus ring around the view when it receives keyboard focus.

---

### `focusable`

Determines whether the view can receive keyboard focus.

| Type | Default |
| ---- | ------- |
| bool | `false` |

When `true`, the view can be focused using keyboard navigation (e.g., Tab key).

---

### `keyDownEvents`

Specifies which key down events should be handled by the view.

| Type                    |
| ----------------------- |
| array of HandledKey     |

An array of key configurations that the view should handle. Each `HandledKey` object can specify:
- `key`: The key value (aligned with [W3C UI Events](https://www.w3.org/TR/uievents-key/))
- `altKey` (optional): Whether Alt/Option key must be pressed
- `ctrlKey` (optional): Whether Control key must be pressed  
- `shiftKey` (optional): Whether Shift key must be pressed
- `metaKey` (optional): Whether Command key must be pressed

Example:
```javascript
keyDownEvents={[
  { key: 'Enter' },
  { key: 'a', metaKey: true }
]}
```

---

### `keyUpEvents`

Specifies which key up events should be handled by the view.

| Type                    |
| ----------------------- |
| array of HandledKey     |

An array of key configurations that the view should handle when keys are released. Uses the same format as `keyDownEvents`.

---

### `mouseDownCanMoveWindow`

Controls whether clicking and dragging on the view can move the window.

| Type | Default |
| ---- | ------- |
| bool | `true`  |

When `true`, clicking and dragging on the view will allow the user to move the window. Set to `false` for interactive elements where you don't want this behavior.

---

### `tooltip`

Displays a tooltip when the user hovers over the view.

| Type   |
| ------ |
| string |

The text to display in the tooltip.

---

## Example Usage

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';

function MacOSView() {
  return (
    <View
      style={{ width: 200, height: 100 }}
      focusable={true}
      enableFocusRing={true}
      tooltip="This is a macOS view"
      acceptsFirstMouse={true}
      draggedTypes={['public.file-url']}
      keyDownEvents={[
        { key: 'Enter' },
        { key: 's', metaKey: true }
      ]}
      onKeyDown={(event) => {
        console.log('Key pressed:', event.nativeEvent.key);
      }}
    >
      <Text>macOS View</Text>
    </View>
  );
}
```
