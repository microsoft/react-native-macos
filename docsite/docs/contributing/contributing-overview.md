# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to React Native! Feel free to file or issues or open PRs into React Native macOS. 

Because React Native macOS is a fork of React Native, we follow some rules to keep our commit history happy and our diffs with upstream manageable. The rest of this guide will focus on explaining our diffs, along with a guide for how to drive a release for those working on the repo.
